# NCEAS Sci Comp Team Tasks

A project-neutral version controlled repository for all scripts that don't fit neatly under an existing repository that cannot be written as standalone functions

## Instructions for Contributing

Given that this repository is meant to be a sort of "grab bag" of unrelated scripts we have developed some guidelines for contributing to keep things relatively organized. These rules will also help when future Sci Comp staff attempt to decipher this repository and they will thank you for your efforts now!

When you are adding a script, **check to see if an existing folder makes sense to house your script**.

### If there **is** an existing folder:

1.  Put your script in that folder
2.  Add a short (1-2 sentence) description of your script to the README.md file in that folder

### If there **is not** an existing folder:

1.  Create a folder that meets the following criteria:
    -   Prefix of either "misc\_" or "wg\_" depending on whether the script was built for a working group ("wg") or for some other purpose ("misc")
    -   All lowercase
    -   Underscores ("\_") to separate words
2.  Put your script in that folder
3.  Create a README.md in that folder with a short (1-2 sentence) description of your script
     -   See existing folders' READMEs for examples if needed
