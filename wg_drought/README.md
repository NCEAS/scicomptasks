# Drought Working Group Scripts

## Script explanation

**"drought-rtrial.R"**

 - R script to demonstrate to the drought working group one method of performing their tidying pathway in R (as of June 2022 they use a legacy SQL script that is opaque even to most of their group members)
 
 **"drought-mod-export-fxn.R"**
 
 - R script that accepts a fit model of one of the three tests used by the drought WG and exports a table of rounded summary statistics as a .csv
 
  **"drought-export-model-test.R"**

- R script that was used to develop the formal function included in "drought-mod-export-fxn.R"
