To that end, we have created the R package scicomptools!\n\n\n\nThis package contains a diverse mix of functions for everything from repetitive data wrangling tasks to checking whether you have a token attached for GitHub. In addition, functions that we wrote that are deprecated (usually because their internal workings have been superseded by packages on CRAN) are removed from the package but retained in the GitHub repository in case they are useful to you! All functions–both live and deprecated–are summarized in the README on the GitHub repository so take a look!\n\n\n\nTo install the package in R, use the following:\n\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"NCEAS/scicomptools\")"

    "section": "Best Practices: File Paths",
    "text": "Best Practices: File Paths\nThis section contains our recommendations for handling file paths on NCEAS analytical server. When sharing code collaboratively (e.g., with GitHub) managing the difference between your folder structure and those of your colleagues can be tackled in a variety of ways. Failing to account for this can result in annoying errors where content is either not read in successfully or is exported to the wrong folder. For content inside your working directory, we recommend using relative paths. However sometimes you need to read files from folders that are outside your working directory, for example large datasets shared among your team members.\nBelow are our recommendations for file path management in a team context; we hope they help!\n\n1) Preserve File Paths as Objects\nFirst and foremost, we recommend that you begin each script (just after loading your libraries) by saving all the paths to your files as objects. This makes it easy for each new user to remember that they might need to alter those objects so that data are read in and saved out to the appropriate places.\n\nmy_path <- \"path/to/my/file/\"\nmy_path\n\n[1] \"path/to/my/file/\"\n\n\n\n\n2) Use file.path() to Make Path Objects\nfile.path() is a useful base R function that automatically accounts for the fact that Mac and PC operating systems use different slashes between folder names to indicate a path (one uses ‘/’ and the other uses ‘\\’)\n\nmy_path <- file.path(\"path\", \"to\", \"my\", \"file\")\nmy_path\n\n[1] \"path/to/my/file\"\n\n\nNote that while you could use paste(..., sep = '/') instead, it does not account for the different slash between Mac and PC so file.path() is preferable.\n\n\n3) Use Path Objects when Reading/Writing Data\nNow that you’ve saved your paths as objects using file.path() to account for operating system differences, you should use them during import/export steps! To do this, just wrap the argument (i.e., part of the function) that deals with the file name/path in another call to file.path() with the object you created earlier and the name of the file to import/export. See below for two examples:\n\n# Import\nmy_raw_data <- read.csv(file = file.path(my_path, \"raw_data.csv\"))\n\n# Export\nwrite.csv(x = data_object, file = file.path(my_path, \"tidy_data.csv\"))\n\n\n\nFile Path Summary\nWe strongly recommend preserving your file paths as objects at the start of your scripts (using file.path()) to ensure that your scripts can be shared as easily as possible among your team without issues due to user-specific folder names or computer operating system interrupting the work that you set out to do."

We primarily work with LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) Working Groups and provide all manner of data-adjacent assistance. This can include offering workshops on new skills or programs, helping you get set up on NCEAS’ server, acquiring data from third parties, or writing code to wrangle, analyze, or visualize the data your group has already collected. Depending on your team’s preferences, we can operate on a spectrum of independence ranging from complete self-sufficiency after initial definition of task scope to coding together with your team.\nPlease feel free to take a look at our NCEAS information page here as well.\n\nPast Workshops\nWe have offered workshops in the past including the following:\n\nCollaborative Coding with GitHub in RStudio\n\nA pared-down version of this workshop was offered at the 2022 All Scientists’ Meeting"
