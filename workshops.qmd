In addition to the specific task-based support we offer LTER working groups, we can also create and run interactive workshops on data or coding topics. The specific goals of these workshops can be modified to best suit your team and meet all attendees where they are to ensure no one is left behind. While we are always happy to discuss developing new workshops we do have some materials that have already been designed (and tested by other working groups!) and are happy to offer any of these workshops to your group if it is of interest.

## Collaborative Coding with GitHub

In synthesis science, collaboration on code products is often integral to the productivity of the group. However, learning to use the software and graphical user interfaces that support this kind of teamwork can be a significant hurdle for teams that are already experts in their subject areas. This workshop is aimed at helping participants gain an understanding of the fundamental purpose and functioning of "version control" systems--specifically [GitHub](https://github.com/)--to help teams more effectively code collaboratively.

## Coding in the `tidyverse`

For teams that code using the R programming language, the most familiar tools are often part of "base R" meaning that those functions and packages come pre-loaded when R is installed. Relatively recently the `tidyverse` has emerged as a comprehensive suite of packages that can complement base R or serve as an alternative for some tasks. This includes packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr` as well as the perhaps infamous pipe operator (`%>%`) among many other tools. This workshop is aimed at helping participants use the `tidyverse` equivalents of fundamental data wrangling tasks that learners may be used to performing with base R.
