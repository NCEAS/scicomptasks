# Plant Reproduction Working Group Scripts

## Script explanation

**"TRY_wrangling.R"**

- R script to wrangle data pulled from TRY in order to prepare for integration

**"trait_integration.R"**

- R script to integrate the working group's own data with TRY data in order to produce a harmonized data set

**"attributes_summary_stats.R"**

- R script to calculate some statistics for the data set exported from **trait_integration.R**

**"plant-repro-compadre.R"**

 - R script to compare which of the species sampled by the Plant Repro WG have traits in the [COMPADRE plant trait database](https://compadre-db.org/)

**"Correlations_dataPrep_JML_Feb2023_NL.R"**

- R script for testing loops across models. Static download from an email from Jalene so the eventual "actual" script may live elsewhere in GitHub (possibly in the Plant Repro GH repo?)
