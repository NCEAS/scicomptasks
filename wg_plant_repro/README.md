# Plant Reproduction Working Group Scripts

## Script explanation

**"plant-repro-compadre.R"**

 - R script to compare which of the species sampled by the Plant Repro WG have traits in the [COMPADRE plant trait database](https://compadre-db.org/)

**"Correlations_dataPrep_JML_Feb2023_NL.R"**

- R script for testing loops across models. Static download from an email from Jalene so the eventual "actual" script may live elsewhere in GitHub (possibly in the Plant Repro GH repo?)
